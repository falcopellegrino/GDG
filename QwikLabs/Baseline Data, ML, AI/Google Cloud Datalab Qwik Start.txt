Cloud Datalab is an interactive data analysis and machine learning environment designed for Google Cloud Platform.
ou can use it to explore, analyze, transform, and visualize your data interactively and to build machine learning models from your data.

Cloud Datalab uses notebooks instead of the text files containing code.
Notebooks bring together code, documentation written as markdown, and the results of code executionâ€”whether as text, image, or HTML/JavaScript.
Like a code editor or IDE, notebooks help you write code: they allow you to execute code in an interactive and iterative manner, rendering the results alongside the code.
Further, when you share a notebook with team members, you can include code, markdown-formatted documentation, and results that include interactive charts,
to provide them with context that goes beyond what Python or SQL code files alone can provide.
