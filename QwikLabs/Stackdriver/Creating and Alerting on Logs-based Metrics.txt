Logs-based metrics are Stackdriver Monitoring metrics that are based on the content of log entries.
It can help you identify trends, extract numeric values out of the logs, and set up an alert when a certain log entry occurs by creating a metric for that event.
You can use both system and user-defined logs-based metrics in Stackdriver Monitoring to create charts and alerting policies.
Logs-based metrics are time series that are generated from data in logs.
