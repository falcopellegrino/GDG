Stackdriver Monitoring provides dashboards and alerts so you can review performance metrics for cloud services, virtual machines,
	and common open source servers such as MongoDB, Apache, Nginx, Elasticsearch, and more.
You configure Stackdriver Monitoring using the Stackdriver Monitoring Console.

Stackdriver lets you define and monitor groups of resources, such as VM instances, databases, and load balancers.
Groups can be based on names, tags, regions, applications, and other criteria.
You can also create subgroups, up to six levels deep, within groups.
