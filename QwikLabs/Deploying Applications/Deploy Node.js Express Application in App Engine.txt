Google App Engine applications are easy to create, easy to maintain, and easy to scale as your traffic and data storage needs change.
With App Engine, there are no servers to maintain.
You simply upload your application and it's ready to go.
App Engine applications automatically scale based on
incoming traffic, load balancing, microservices, authorization, SQL and NoSQL databases, Memcache, traffic splitting, logging, search, versioning, roll out and roll backs,
and security scanning are all supported natively and are highly customizable.
App Engine's environments, the Standard Environment and the Flexible environment, support a host of programming languages, including Java, Python, PHP, Node.js, Go, etc..
The two environments give users maximum flexibility in how their application behaves since each environment has certain strengths.

gcloud is the powerful and unified command-line tool for Google Cloud Platform
