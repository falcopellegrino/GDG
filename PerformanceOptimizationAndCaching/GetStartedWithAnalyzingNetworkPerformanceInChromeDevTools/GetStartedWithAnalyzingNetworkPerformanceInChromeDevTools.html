// Get Started with Analyzing Network Performance in Chrome DevTools

// Learn how to use the Chrome DevTools Network panel to understand why a page loads slowly in this step-by-step, interactive tutorial.



// Step 1: Set up DevTools

//  1. Suppose that you're receiving reports from mobile users that a particular page on your site is slow. Your job is to make the page fast.
//      Click Open Slow Page. The page opens in a new tab.
//      OPEN SLOW PAGE
//      https://googlechrome.github.io/devtools-samples/network/gs/v1.html
//  2. While the page is in focus, press Command+Option+I (Mac) or Control+Shift+I (Windows, Linux) to open DevTools on the page.
//  3. In DevTools, click the Network tab.
//      https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/network-performance/imgs/get-started-network-panel.png
//      Figure 1. The Chrome DevTools Network panel, opened next to the slow page that you're going to diagnose.
//  Note: For the rest of the screenshots, DevTools is undocked to a separate window, so that you can see its contents better.
//  https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/ui#placement
//  4. Enable Capture Screenshots, which turns blue when enabled. DevTools captures screenshots during the page load.



// Step 2: Emulate a mobile user's experience

// Testing network performance on a laptop or desktop can be deceiving.
// Your internet connection is much faster than a mobile user's, and your browser caches resources from previous visits.
//  1. Check the Disable Cache checkbox.
//      When this checkbox is enabled, DevTools doesn't serve any resources from the cache.
//      This more accurately emulates what first-time users experience when they view your page.
//  2. From the dropdown menu that currently says No Throttling, select Regular 2G.
//      DevTools throttles the network connection to simulate a regular 2G experience.
//      This is how mobile users experience your site in places with poor connections.
//      https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/network-performance/imgs/get-started-setup.svg
//      Figure 2. The Chrome DevTools Network panel, set up to emulate a mobile user's experience.
//          Screenshots, cache disabling, and throttling are outlined in blue, from left to right, respectively.
//      This is a worst-case setup.
//      If you can get your page loading fast on this setup, it'll be fast for all your users!



// Step 3: Analyze requests

// Figure out what's making the page slow by reloading the page and analyzing the requests that come in.

// Part A: Find render-blocking scripts

// When the browser encounters a <script> tag, it must pause rendering and execute the script immediately.
// Find scripts that aren't needed for page load and mark them asynchronous or defer their execution to speed up load time.
//  1. Press Command+R (Mac) or Control+R (Windows, Linux) to reload the page.
//      On a good Wi-Fi connection, the page takes more than 10 seconds to load completely.
//      https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/network-performance/imgs/get-started-post-load.png
//      Figure 3. The Chrome DevTools Network panel, after reloading the page.
//  2. Note the value for DOMContentLoaded in the Summary pane, on the bottom of the Network panel.
//      You should see a value of at least 4 seconds.
//      When you see this event firing late like this, be on the lookout for scripts that are delaying the main document's load and parse.
//  3. Click main.js to investigate that request further.
//      DevTools shows a set of new tabs that provide more information about this request.
//  4. Click the Preview tab to view the request's source code.
//      You can see that the script just hangs for 4000ms.
//      By marking this script with the async attribute and moving it to the bottom of the document's <body>, the page can load without waiting for the script.
//      https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/network-performance/imgs/get-started-preview.png
//      Figure 4. Viewing the source code for main.js in the Preview pane.
// See Parser-blocking versus asynchronous JavaScript to learn more about render-blocking scripts.
// https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path/adding-interactivity-with-javascript#parser_blocking_versus_asynchronous_javascript

// Part B: Find large requests

// When the page loaded, did you notice that the DevTools logo took a long time to load? It's not blocking the load, but it's making the page appear slow.
// Users like it when pages appear fast.
//  1. Click Close Close so that you can see the Requests pane again.
//      https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/network-performance/reference#requests
//  2. Double-click on the top-left screenshot.
//  3. Press your right-arrow key to scan through the set of screenshots.
//      The time below the screenshot indicates when the screenshot was taken.
//      The screenshot takes multiple seconds to load. That means it's probably too large of a file.
//  4. Click anywhere outside of the screenshot to minimize it.
//  5. Hover over the Waterfall for the logo-1024px.png request.
//      https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/network-performance/reference#waterfall
//      The request spends most of its time downloading the image.
//      This confirms that the image is too large.
//      Figure 5. The waterfall for logo-1024px.png.



// Step 4: Verify fixes on updated page

// You're just about done.
// Suppose now that you've already made two changes to the page:
//  - You moved the script to the bottom of the <body> and marked it async to prevent it from blocking the page load.
//  - You converted the logo to SVG to reduce its size.

// All that's left to do is to test out the updated page to verify that your fixes do indeed make the page load faster.
//  1. Click Open Fast Page.
//      The fixed page opens in a new tab.
//      OPEN FAST PAGE
//      https://googlechrome.github.io/devtools-samples/network/gs/v2.html
//  2. Set up DevTools the same as before.
//      Screenshots and cache disabling should be on, and network throttling should be set to Regular 2G.
//  3. Reload the page. The page loads much faster.
//      https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/network-performance/imgs/get-started-post-fix.png
//      Figure 6. A recording of the page's load, after applying the fixes.
//      The page used to take about 10 seconds to appear visually complete.
//      Now it only takes about 1 second.

// Note: Although the page loads much faster, it's still unusable for about 5 seconds.
// This is because it still runs the script that hangs the main thread of the page.



// Next Steps

// Good job.
// You are now a bona fide expert in the Chrome DevTools Network panel.
// Well... maybe not an expert.
// You do have an excellent foundation of skills and knowledge, though.
