// Performance Optimization and Caching

// Mobile users demand websites that load nearly instantly, despite poor or absent connectivity.
// Because many users also face expensive data caps, you must minimize their application's data footprint to reduce page load time as much as possible.
// You'll be asked to show you can carry out performance audits on applications to reduce page load times and maintain responsive user experiences by:
//  - Preventing main thread blocking with a dedicated web worker
//  - Providing an optimized critical rendering path using:
//      - Compressed or minified JavaScript, HTML and CSS files to reduce render blocking
//      - Inline CSS for essential styles on a specific page, with asynchronous loading for additional styles as necessary
//      - Inline JavaScript files for initial rendering only where necessary (or otherwise eliminated, deferred, or marked as async)
//      - Ordered loading of remaining critical resources and early download of all critical assets to shorten the critical path length
//      - Reduced DOM depth to minimize browser layout/reflow
//      - Your browser's developer tools to diagnose performance issues on mobile devices
//  - Prefetching files that load when resources are available, reducing the time to meaningful interaction
//  - Providing client storage that is appropriate to a web applicationâ€™s data persistence needs, including:
//      - Session state management
//      - Asset caching based on their impact on load time and offline functionality
//      - Using IndexedDB to store dynamic content in offline mode
